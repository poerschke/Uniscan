Welcome to Uniscan project.

Uniscan is an open source vulnerability scanner for Web applications.

## Instructions
`install_modules.sh` is a shell script that will run the Perl module
dependencies installation.

You may use the dependency-installation script, but it is strongly
recommended to check your OS distribution's package manager and install
the dependency packages from the package manager accordingly.
